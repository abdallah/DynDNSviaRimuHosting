# DynDNS via RimuHosting
Dynamic DNS service for personal use (home router) using the RimuHosting/Zonomi.com service

Some routers (like my Thomson) need a username/password to connect (an API key does not work). 
The php script is pretty easy to setup on any php enabled server (ie. shared hosting)
You should add some basic authentication via .htaccess (see sample)
